## Environment Setup:

1. Assume you have Python 3.10

```shell
# From the repository root
python3.10 --version   # should print Python 3.10.x
python3.10 -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
source venv/bin/activate

# (optional but recommended) upgrade pip
python -m pip install -U pip
```

2. Follow README.md to install dependencies.

```shell
cd code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. PyCharm: point the Project Interpreter at the `venv`

If you use PyCharm, configure it to use the virtualenv you created above.

**a. Open the project**

- `File → Open…` and select the repository root (the folder that contains `venv/`).

**b. Open Interpreter settings**

- **Windows/Linux:** `File → Settings…`
- **macOS:** `PyCharm → Preferences…`
- Then go to `Project: <your project> → Python Interpreter`.

**c. Select the `venv`**

- If PyCharm already lists the `venv` interpreter, select it and click **OK/Apply**.
- Otherwise, click **Add Interpreter** (or the ⚙️ gear icon → **Add…**) → **Existing environment** and browse to:
    - **macOS/Linux:** `<repo>/venv/bin/python`
    - **Windows:** `<repo>\venv\Scripts\python.exe`
- Click **OK**, then **Apply**.

4. Create a .env file using .env.example and add your API keys. DO NOT COMMIT YOUR API KEYS.
5. Test API key in Python Shell:

```python 
import os, openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv;

load_dotenv()
openai.api_base = os.getenv("TOGETHER_BASE_URL", "https://api.together.xyz/v1")
openai.api_key = os.getenv("TOGETHER_API_KEY")
r = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Reply with exactly: OK"}],
    temperature=0
)
print(r["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

You should get something like this:

```
>>> r = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
...     model="meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free",
...     messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Reply with exactly: OK"}],
...     temperature=0
... )
>>> print(r["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
OK
>>> print(r)
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "finish_reason": "stop",
      "index": 0,
      "logprobs": null,
      "message": {
        "content": "OK",
        "role": "assistant",
        "tool_calls": []
      },
      "seed": 16791737139537046000
    }
  ],
  "created": 1760223489,
  "id": "oEovV3E-4Yz4kd-98d1f5e4eccf5580",
  "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "prompt": [],
  "usage": {
    "cached_tokens": 0,
    "completion_tokens": 2,
    "prompt_tokens": 40,
    "total_tokens": 42
  }
}
>>> 
```

6. Run demo file to see if it works.

```shell
python code/demo/run_DyLAN.py > code/demo/ans.txt
```

You should get something like this:

```
Query: What 8 letter word can have a letter taken away and it still makes a word. Take another letter away and it still makes a word. Keep on doing that until you have one letter left. What is the word?

| Assistant | The word you are looking for is "starting".                                                                                                                  | The problem asks for an 8-letter word that can have letters removed successively to form new words, until only one letter is left.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the removal of letters does not always result in a valid word. For example, removing "t" from "starting" to get "staring" is valid, but removing "a" from "staring" to get "string" is not a valid step, as the original word was "staring", not "string".                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Agent response 1 suggests the word "starting" but the breakdown provided does not always result in a valid word. Agent response 2 also suggests that "starting" is not the correct answer and provides alternative sequences, but these sequences are also flawed. Agent response 3 suggests the word "spurring" but the breakdown provided is not perfect. Agent response 4 suggests the word "shorting" and provides a breakdown that seems plausible. |

Final Answer: To address the question, let's examine the problem statement and the solutions provided by other agents. The problem asks for an 8-letter word that can have letters removed successively, with each resulting word being a valid English word, until only one letter remains.

Upon examining the solutions provided by the other agents, it appears that they all have flaws in their approach. Agent response 1 suggests the word "starting" but the breakdown provided does not always result in a valid word. Agent response 2 also suggests that "starting" is not the correct answer and provides alternative sequences, but these sequences are also flawed. Agent response 3 suggests the word "spurring" but the breakdown provided is not perfect. Agent response 4 suggests the word "shorting" and provides a breakdown that seems plausible.

Let's examine the solution provided by Agent response 4 in detail:

1. Shorting (8 letters)
2. Sorting (7 letters) - Remove "h"
3. Sort (4 letters) - Remove "ing"
4. So (2 letters) - Remove "r"
5. S (1 letter) - Remove "o"

This solution seems plausible, but let's check if there are any other words that can fit the criteria. After re-examining the problem, I found that the word "shorting" indeed meets the criteria, but there might be other words that fit better.

To evaluate the solutions provided by other agents, I would score them as follows: [[2, 3, 4, 5]]. Agent response 1 provided a flawed solution, Agent response 2 provided some alternative sequences but they were not perfect, Agent response 3 provided a plausible solution but it was not perfect, and Agent response 4 provided a good solution.

In conclusion, based on the information provided and the analyses conducted by other agents, the 8-letter word that can have letters removed successively to form new words, until only one letter is left, is indeed "shorting". This conclusion is supported by the step-by-step breakdown that shows how "shorting" can be reduced to a single letter, "S", with each intermediate step being a valid English word.

The final answer is "shorting". 

Note: The original question is a classic example of a lateral thinking puzzle, and the solution requires careful examination and creative thinking. The provided solutions by other agents are not all correct, and a correct solution requires a different approach. 

Also, note that there might be other words that fit the criteria, and the solution provided is just one possible example. A comprehensive search of the language is required to find all possible solutions. 

In the case of the word "starting", a correct sequence could be:
1. Starting (8 letters)
2. Staring (7 letters) - remove "t"
3. String is not a correct sequence, but 
   Staring -> Star (remove "ing")
   Star -> Tar (remove "s")
   Tar -> Ar (remove "t")
   Ar -> A (remove "r")

This sequence is different from the one provided by the other agents, and it shows that "starting" can be reduced to a single letter, "A", with each intermediate step being a valid English word. 

However, the word "shorting" is a better example of a word that meets the criteria, and the sequence provided by Agent response 4 is a good solution. 

It's worth noting that the problem statement does not specify that the resulting words should be commonly used or recognized English words, but rather that they should be valid English words. Therefore, the solution provided should be evaluated based on the validity of the resulting words, rather than their common usage or recognition. 

In any case, the solution provided is just one possible example, and there might be other words that fit the criteria. A comprehensive search of the language is required to find all possible solutions. 

The final answer is "shorting".

7. Download the MMLU dataset under this path `<repository_root>/data/MMLU`. Under `MMLU`, you should see auxiliary,
   test, val, and train folders. You can use the link from
   their [repo](https://github.com/hendrycks/test?tab=readme-ov-file#). We can start by using `val` and evaluate with
   `test` later. DyLAN doesn't use few-shot prompting so they don't rely on dev nor does it do fine tuning using
   auxiliary_train so we can skip using that for now. I am using test to start for simplicity of implementation.

8. Preprocess dataset:

```shell
# From the repository root
python code/preprocess/mmlu_prepare_subsets_v2.py \
  --mmlu-root data/MMLU \
  --seed 0 \
  --eval-frac 0.20 \
  --sel-small-frac 0.01 \
  --sel-large-frac 0.10
```

9. To test run under code/MMLU:

```shell
# From repo root
cd code/MMLU

# Recommended: override these per run
export MODEL="meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free"
export MMLU_DIR="$PWD/../../data/MMLU/small_team_selection"   # your 1% slice
export EXP_NAME="mmlu_1pct"
export MAX_PARALLEL=4   # throttle concurrent CSV jobs

# Kick off the run (this will ALSO run anal_imp.sh when all jobs finish)
bash exp_mmlu.sh
```

10. TODO: Add instructions to run an exp_mmlu_evaluation.sh script to report accuracy using input from (9).
