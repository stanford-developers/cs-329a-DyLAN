The degree of this extension is 2 because the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2, which is irreducible over Q and has degree 2.\n\n2. **Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q(sqrt(2))**: Adding sqrt(3) to Q(sqrt(2)) introduces another element not in Q(sqrt(2)). The minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q(sqrt(2)) is x^2 - 3, which is irreducible over Q(sqrt(2)) because sqrt(3) cannot be expressed using rational numbers and sqrt(2). Thus, the degree of this extension is also 2.\n\n3. **Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))**: To understand the contribution of sqrt(18), we simplify it. Since sqrt(18) = sqrt(9*2) = 3*sqrt(2), it's clear that sqrt(18) is already in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) because we have both sqrt(2) and the rational number 3 in this field. Therefore, adding sqrt(18) does not extend the field further.\n\nGiven these considerations, the total degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q can be calculated as the product of the degrees of each step of the extension, where the steps are independent (i.e., each new element cannot be expressed in terms of the previous ones). \n\n- The degree of Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is 2.\n- The degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q(sqrt(2)) is 2.\n- The degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is 1 (or 0, depending on how you view it, since sqrt(18) does not actually extend the field).\n\nThus, the total degree is 2 * 2 * 1 = 4.\n\n(B)", null, null], ["To find the degree of the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q, we first need to understand what each component brings to the extension.\n\n1. **Q(sqrt(2)) over Q**: This extension introduces the irrational number sqrt(2) into the field of rational numbers Q. The degree of this extension, denoted as [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q], is 2 because the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2, which is of degree 2.\n\n2. **Q(sqrt(3)) over Q**: Similarly, introducing sqrt(3) into Q gives us an extension of degree 2, as the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q is x^2 - 3, also of degree 2.\n\n3. **Q(sqrt(18)) over Q**: Before considering its interaction with the other extensions, let's analyze sqrt(18) on its own. Since sqrt(18) = sqrt(9*2) = 3*sqrt(2), it is already contained in Q(sqrt(2)) because we can obtain sqrt(18) by multiplying sqrt(2) by 3, which is in Q. Thus, Q(sqrt(18)) does not add any new elements that aren't already in Q(sqrt(2)).\n\nGiven these observations, let's consider the composite field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)).

However, when we combine them, we need to consider their interaction. Because sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are linearly independent over Q (one cannot be expressed as a rational multiple of the other), the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is the product of their individual degrees, which is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nThus, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q, considering that sqrt(18) does not contribute any additional dimension beyond what sqrt(2) already provides, is also 4.\n\n(B)", null, null], [null, null, null], ["To find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q, we first note that the degree of a field extension is the dimension of the extended field as a vector space over the base field. \n\nWe start by simplifying the extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)). Notice that sqrt(18) can be simplified as sqrt(18) = sqrt(9*2) = 3*sqrt(2). Since 3 is already in Q, the presence of sqrt(18) does not add any new dimension that isn't already covered by sqrt(2). Therefore, we can simplify our extension to Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, consider the degrees of the individual extensions:\n- The degree of Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is 2 because the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2, which is irreducible over Q and of degree 2.\n- The degree of Q(sqrt(3)) over Q is also 2 for similar reasons; the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q is x^2 - 3, which is irreducible over Q and of degree 2.\n\nHowever, when combining these extensions, we must consider if there's any overlap or relationship that could reduce the overall degree. Since sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are linearly independent over Q (one is not a rational multiple of the other), and there are no algebraic relationships between them that would reduce the dimension (such as one being a root of a polynomial with coefficients in the field generated by the other), the degrees multiply.\n\nThus, the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is the product of the degrees of Q(sqrt(2)) over Q and Q(sqrt(3)) over Q, which gives us 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nSo, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q, simplified to Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q, is 4.\n\n(B)", null, null], ["To find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q, we first need to understand what each of these terms means and how they relate to each other.\n\nQ represents the field of rational numbers.
